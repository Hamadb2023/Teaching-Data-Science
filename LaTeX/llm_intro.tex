% \item Tokens are currently limited to 4000 tokens per output. This includes both your initial prompt the text generated
% from ChatGPT.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{So, What are LLMs?}

  Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, ushering in advancements in text generation and understanding. Key attributes include:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning from Extensive Data:} LLMs acquire knowledge from vast datasets, resembling a massive library of information.

    \item \textbf{Grasping Context and Entities:} These models understand context and entities, allowing for a deeper comprehension of language.

    \item \textbf{Proficient User Query Responses:} LLMs excel in responding to user queries, showcasing their ability to apply learned knowledge effectively.

  \end{itemize}

  Despite their versatile applications across industries, ethical concerns and potential biases necessitate a critical evaluation to understand their societal impact.

\end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Takeaways}

  % \begin{itemize}
    % \item LLMs comprehend complex sentences, relationships between entities, and user intent.
    % \item LLM architecture: embedding, feedforward, recurrent, and attention layers.
    % \item Popular LLMs like Palm and GPT-3, along with open-source alternatives.
    % \item Hugging Face APIs aid in generating text using LLMs.
    % % \item LLMs are anticipated to revolutionize job markets, communication, and society, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of their limitations and ethical implications.
  % \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Large Language Models Training}
  % \begin{itemize}
    % \item Trained on internet data, including dark content.
    % \item Exposure to racist, sexist, and offensive language.
    % \item May regurgitate such language in generated text.
  % \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Core Beliefs of Large Language Models}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item No inherent "core beliefs."
    \item Word guessers predicting internet-like sentences.
    \item Can write both for and against a topic without belief.
    \item Emulates the most common response in training data.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Truth and Morality in Large Language Models}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lack sense of truth or morality.
    \item Tendency to generate words we agree are true.
    \item No guarantee of providing the actual truth.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Mistakes in Large Language Models}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prone to mistakes due to inconsistent training data.
    \item Self-attention may not capture all relevant information.
    \item Hallucination: generating words not derived from input.
    \item Preference for common words, small numbers, and specific names.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Auto-regressive Nature of LLMs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Auto-regressive models: guesses affect subsequent inputs.
    \item Errors accumulate, potentially compounding mistakes.
    \item No mechanism to "change minds" or self-correct.
    \item Lack the ability to retry or undo prior choices.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Verification of Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always verify outputs of large language models.
    \item Assess competence to verify results in high-stakes tasks.
    \item Mistakes in critical tasks may lead to costly decisions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Self-Attention and Input Quality}
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item Self-attention enhances specialization in responses.
    % \item Response quality is proportional to input prompt quality.
    % \item Experiment with different prompts to achieve better results.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conversation with Large Language Models}
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item No real "conversation" as models don't remember past exchanges.
    % \item Input, response, and follow-up treated as fresh inputs.
    % \item Programming trick creates appearance of continuous conversation.
    % \item No guarantee against contradictions in responses.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Input Size and Memory Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large language models have input size limits.
    \item Conversation appears coherent until log size exceeds limit.
    \item Earlier parts of the conversation are deleted, and the model "forgets."
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Problem-Solving and Planning}
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item Large language models don't perform problem-solving or planning.
    % \item Lack specific goals; they have an objective of word prediction.
    % \item No look-ahead mechanism; transformers are backward-looking.
    % \item Large language models can generate plan-like outputs.
    % \item Recognize plans from training data but lack thoughtful consideration.
    % \item No mechanism for considering alternatives or backtracking.
% \end{itemize}
