\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item RL helps us to discover which action could yield the highest reward for a longer time. 
\item Realistic environments can have partial observability and be non-stationary as well. 
\item It isnâ€™t very useful to apply when you have hands-on enough data to solve the problem using supervised learning. \item The main challenge of this method is that parameters could affect the speed of the learning.
\end{itemize}
