		Constitutional AI trains to follow a set of high-level principles or rules, such as a constitution, that specify the desired behavior and outcomes of the system.
		RLHF uses human feedback, such as ratings, preferences, or corrections, to optimize a language model or an agentâ€™s policy using reinforcement learning
