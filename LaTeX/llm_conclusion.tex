\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Advantages}


\begin{itemize}
\item Conversational Abilities
\item Solving Complex Problems
\item Retaining Previous Information
% \item Creative Assistant, random-mix-ideas
\item Will replace mundane language tasks, How to articles, homework, etc
% \item Supports more complex instructions, ``reasoning'' tasks
\end{itemize}	 

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Dis-advantages}


\begin{itemize}
\item Sensitive to Input Phrasing
% \item Incorrect Answers at Times
\item Cannot replace humans for innovation, for which data does not exist already
\item Keeps ``hallucinating'': Tends to write plausible but incorrect content with confidence
\item May not get language structure right all the time, e.g try getting ghazal written
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Compared to humans?}


\begin{itemize}
\item Although GPT models are far more knowledgeable due to vast training (GPT-3 was trained on 499B tokens, GPT-4 on 1.4 T tokens whereas a human can read about 5.26B tokens in 80 years)
\item It's not about the volume of data \ldots
\item  Children can talk long before they reach adulthood, and it's likely that $<$ 1B tokens is enough for a human to master language. Need to figure out how nature has made her neural network so efficient.
\item Imagine the pretraining done over billions of years at the time a baby comes ready with
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Future scope}

\begin{itemize}
\item Planning and task loops (for handling multi hop queries)
\item LLM based post processing (Entity Extractions)
\item Temporal Querying (find abc from last 3 weeks)
\item Resolving conflicting data (when two different values for capital of India)
\item Improve explanability and interpret-ability
\end{itemize}
